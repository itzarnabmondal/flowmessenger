# FlowMessenger
FlowMessenger is a web-based messaging application designed for portability, security, and ease of deployment. The application is built using Spring Boot, Vaadin Flow, and HSQLDB in embedded mode, with the aim of creating a single executable `.jar` file. Users can run this executable on any hardware/software architecture with a Java Runtime Environment using the command `java -jar flowmessenger.jar`. The application will create a directory named `flowmessenger` in the user's home directory (`$HOME` or `user.home`) and save all data within that directory.
